  <h2>About</h2>
  <p>
    Sound Shallows is an independent electronic project exploring time, identity, and the quiet fear of being forgotten, along with the small rebellions we make against disappearing, even when the struggle is with ourselves.
  </p>

  <div style="height: 15px;"></div>

  <p>
    The project grew out of the tension between who we feel ourselves to be and the lives we find ourselves living. It exists in the space where memory feels heavier than expectation, and where reflection can be both comforting and unsettling.
  </p>

  <div style="height: 15px;"></div>

  <p>
    Musically, Sound Shallows is built from piano, distortion, and slow-burning tension. Tracks often begin gently and gradually accumulate weight, allowing discomfort and emotion to surface rather than resolving too quickly. Some pieces are warm and minimal. Others are heavy, cinematic, or abrasive. The contrast is intentional.
  </p>

  <div style="height: 15px;"></div>

  <p>
    Each release is part of a larger narrative. Rather than standalone tracks, the music is designed as a series of moments, reflections on memory, identity, and the shifting distance between who we were, who we are, and who we refuse to stop becoming. Motifs reappear, themes evolve, and songs quietly reference one another across releases.
  </p>

  <div style="height: 15px;"></div>

  <p>
    Sound Shallows is not an attempt to freeze time or pretend nothing changes. It is an acknowledgement that change is constant, and that creating something honest can be its own form of resistance.
  </p>

  <div style="height: 30px;"></div>

  <h2>Influences</h2>
  <p>
    Classical minimalism, industrial textures, ambient sound design, synth-driven atmospheres, and the emotional weight of 90s alternative music. The project draws from both electronic and acoustic traditions, using contrast as a creative engine.
